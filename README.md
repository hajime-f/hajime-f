<p>I'm Japanese. With a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and a background in Information Science, I have strong programming abilities despite not being a dedicated software engineer. My current work centers around <a href="https://github.com/hajime-f/stocktrading">a Python-based automated trading program for Japanese stocks</a>, driven by Machine Learning algorithms.</p>

<p>I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nishinomiya">Nishinomiya</a>, a quiet city nestled between Osaka and Kobe. It's a popular residential area, consistently ranking high in "desirable places to live" surveys, which is great news for my property values! ...Though, perhaps this isn't quite the kind of thing to include in a GitHub bio (my apologies).</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 personalities test</a>, I'm a <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality">Commander (ENTJ)</a> â€“ just like Steve Jobs, apparently. I'm not sure if I should be happy or worried about that. It does make you wonder how they figured out Jobs was a Commander, though. It's hard to imagine him taking the test himself. Right?</p>

<p>I recently quit my soul-crushing corporate job and am now happily unemployed. For the time being, I plan to make a living by trading stocks using my automated trading program. However, if you happen to know of any interesting job opportunities, please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:hajime.fujita@gmail.com">let me know</a>. I'm confident I can be quite useful ...probably.</p>
