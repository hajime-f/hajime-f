<p>I'm Japanese. With a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and a background in Information Science, I have strong programming abilities despite not being a dedicated software engineer. My current work centers around a Python-based automated trading program for Japanese stocks, driven by Machine Learning algorithms.</p>

<p>I live in Nishinomiya, a quiet city nestled between Osaka and Kobe. It's a popular residential area, consistently ranking high in "desirable places to live" surveys, which is great news for my property values! ...Though, perhaps this isn't quite the kind of thing to include in a GitHub bio (my apologies).</p>

<p>According to the 16 personalities test, I'm a Commander (ENTJ) â€“ just like Steve Jobs, apparently. I'm not sure if I should be happy or worried about that. It does make you wonder how they figured out Jobs was a Commander, though. It's hard to imagine him taking the test himself. Reght?</p>
