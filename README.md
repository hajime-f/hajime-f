<h2>Summary 😏</h2>

<p>I'm Japanese. With a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and a background in Information Science, I have strong programming abilities despite not being a dedicated software engineer. My current work centers around <a href="https://github.com/hajime-f/stocktrading">a Python-based automated trading program for Japanese stocks</a>, driven by Machine Learning algorithms.</p>

<p>I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nishinomiya">Nishinomiya</a>, a quiet city nestled between Osaka and Kobe. It's a popular residential area, consistently ranking high in "desirable places to live" surveys, which is great news for my property values! ...Though, perhaps this isn't quite the kind of thing to include in a GitHub bio (my apologies).</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 personalities test</a>, I'm a <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality">Commander (ENTJ)</a> – just like Steve Jobs, apparently. I'm not sure if I should be happy or worried about that. It does make you wonder how they figured out Jobs was a Commander, though. It's hard to imagine him taking the test himself. Right?</p>

<p>I recently quit my soul-crushing corporate job and am now happily unemployed. For the time being, I plan to make a living by trading stocks using my automated trading program. However, if you happen to know of any interesting job opportunities, please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:hajime.fujita@gmail.com">let me know</a>. I'm confident I can be quite useful ...probably.</p>

<h2>Family 🐈</h2>
<p>I have a wife, no children, but we have a cat named "Hoshi", which means "star" in Japanese. This cat is very attached to my wife, but completely ignores me. However, he sometimes hides behind my Macbook and display. So cute 🥰</p>

<h2>Emacs and Dvorak 🥳</h2>
<p>I've been a dedicated <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> user for about 30 years. While most software engineers these days seem to have switched to VSCode, I remain stubbornly loyal to Emacs (or perhaps I should say, I'm unable to break free from it). And for approximately 25 years, I've been using a <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage360/">Kinesis keyboard</a> with the Dvorak layout.</p>

<p>For engineers, editors and keyboards are essential tools of the trade.  Since they're used daily, it's a good idea for everyone to choose one that they feel comfortable with.</p>

<h2>Desk and Display 😁</h2>
<p>I use an absolutely massive desk with a super-ultrawide monitor. This is the result of my quest for the perfect, most comfortable work environment.</p>

<p>The display is a 49-inch, 5120x1440 resolution behemoth. It arrived at my house in a ridiculously huge, coffin-sized cardboard box. Because it's absurdly wide, I can't even see the edges when I'm facing it directly. But, I love it. The expansive workspace is like the Sahara Desert – I can have my browser and Emacs open to my heart's content.</p>
